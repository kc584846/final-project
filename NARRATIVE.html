    <h1>Personal Narrative</h1>
        <div class="heading2"><h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>I am very happy with the way my final website came out. It took a while at first to plan exactly what I wanted, but once I had a set plan on content and style, it became much easier. I knew I wanted to do a personal portfoilio-type site from the beginning and it was a lot of fun to do. I learned a lot while making my site, like how to implement Bootstrap, float images, and using div classes and IDs to make styling easier.</p>
        <h2>Content</h2>    
            <p>The content for my page was all information about myself. I included a good amount of pictures and tabs with info including a biography, link to my resume, shows I've done at school, an other activities I am a part of.</p>
            <p>My theatre page took the most time, because I linked each individual page for each show to the poster. You click on each picture and the page for info on each show comes up. I was really happy with that idea.</p>
        <h2>Layout</h2>
            <p>I have the same basic layout for most of my pages. I chose to have a navigation bar at the top of every page so you could always jump from page to page no matter what page you were currently on (except my resume page, which I wanted to be it's own separate link). I also wanted my header with my name and my footer with links to social media sites also on every page. So I copied that html onto every page, and just changed the content in the middle depending on the page.</p>
        <h2>Style</h2>
            <p>I had a very set style for all of my pages, and used the same CSS stylesheet for each.</p></div>
                <div class="heading3"><h3>Colors and Fonts</h3>
                    <p>I used the same three or four colors whenever I needed to change text colors. I only really needed it for links. I wanted a different color for the link on its page itself, and then a different color when you hovered over it. I used a magenta, purple, and light blue scheme which matched the background image on my header with my name. The only time I used a different color of orange was on my SJU pages where I had a bunch of links I wanted to stand out. I got my colors from ColourLovers, mainly from one particular palette.</p>
                    <p>The fonts I used were from Google Fonts. I used the same fonts for my h1, h2, paragraphs, and links for each page, keeping it uniform. I struggled to implement the fonts at first, not realizing I had the links in the wrong section of my CSS file. I also used Font Awesome for the icons at the top of my page, which were a lot of fun to use. </p>
                <h3>Background Images</h3>
                    <p>I used two background images, one from Subtle Patterns (the whole page image) and the other from Google (header image). The header image was not completely transparent, but I really liked the image so even though you can tell it repeats, I still left it. I made the header by giving it a height, width, border, andbackground image.</p></div>
        <div class="heading2"><h2>Bootstrap</h2>
            <p>I used Bootstrap to create the navigation bar on my website. For that I looked up different ones until I found one I liked, and put the html into my site. Bootstrap was somewhat difficult for me to figure out at first, and I'm sure there is much more that it can be utilized for, but for now I kept it simple with the navbar, but it made a big difference to my website. At first, I made my own squares right in CSS and was going to link them to different pages as tabs, but the Bootstrap navbar made it look much cleaner and more professional.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Besides figuring out how I wanted to design my site and what content I would put, editing the CSS was pretty tricky. I constantly found myself going back and fixing things. <em>Padding</em> and <em>Margins</em> are two elements I played around with a lot, to get images in their right spots and making the whole content not stretch out to the end of the browser. I did not think the CSS editing would take as long as it did.</p>
            <p>Finding content did take some time too. It took me a while to write most of it, collect images, figure out what goes where etc.</p>
            <p>Overall, this has been such a great experience in web designing!</p>
